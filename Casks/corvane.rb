# Homebrew cask for Corvane. Lives in the `wasi-master/homebrew-corvane` tap
# as `Casks/corvane.rb`. `packaging/release.sh` rewrites `version` and `sha256`.
#
#   brew install --cask wasi-master/corvane/corvane
#
# The bundle is self-signed (no Apple Developer ID), so Gatekeeper blocks a
# quarantined copy on first launch. Homebrew 7 removed `--no-quarantine` and
# always quarantines cask downloads, so `postflight_steps` clears the attribute.

  caveats <<~EOS
    Corvane is self-signed; this cask clears its quarantine attribute so
    Gatekeeper lets it launch. Updates for this install come from
    `brew upgrade corvane`; the in-app updater only points there.
